# oi-checklist

A modern, full-featured web app for tracking progress across major Olympiads in Informatics: from IOI and USACO to APIO and EGOI.

Try it live: [https://checklist.spoi.org.in](https://checklist.spoi.org.in) or explore the interface using a demo account: [https://checklist.spoi.org.in/demo](https://checklist.spoi.org.in/demo).

## Features

- Mark problems as solved, partially solved, or assign exact scores out of 100.
- The checklist currently contains ~2,300 problems from 26 different sources.
- Start official past contests with a live timer and full performance tracking.
- For contests on [oj.uz](https://oj.uz) and [qoj.ac](https://qoj.ac), submissions are auto-synced and scored per subtask.
- Post-contest screens show rank, percentile, medal, and more. Based on actual historical results.
- oj.uz and qoj.ac sync: Automatically update your checklist progress using your past submissions from two major platforms.
- Arrange olympiads in any order you like, and hide those you don't want cluttering your view.
- Attach personal notes to problems for strategy, hints, or reminders, enhanced with a rudimentary markdown editor.

## Local Development Instructions

> Requires Python 3 and node.js installed locally

### Clone the repository

Ensure you have `git` installed.

In any appropriate directory, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avighnac/oi-checklist
cd oi-checklist
```

### Ensure `python3` and python dependencies are installed

Install `python3` and `pip` from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Then run `pip install bs4 requests cloudscraper`. You will need these packages for scraping (oj.uz and qoj.ac sync).

### Install `npm` and node dependencies

Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) from here.

Run `npm install`.

### Create a `.env` file

Create a `.env` file with the following values:

| Variable | Description |
| - | - |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | The exact path to a `.db` file that we'll make in the next step. You can set this to any path you want; for example; I use `file:/Users/avighna/Desktop/oi-checklist/database.db` |
| `ROOT_URL` | Set this to `http://localhost:5501/` |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | Your GitHub client ID |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | Your GitHub client secret |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | Your Discord client ID |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` | Your Discord client secret |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Your Google client ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Your Google client secret |
| `QOJ_USER` | Username for the qoj.ac account used for scraping |
| `QOJ_PASS` | Password for the same qoj.ac account |

Note that every variable other than the first two isn't strictly optional for the app to work. The client IDs and secrets are only needed for OAuth (which you may not need if you're running this locally). The qoj.ac username and password variables are needed for qoj.ac virtual contest scraping (which, again, you may or may not need).

However, they still need to be present in the `.env` file. If youâ€™re not using those features locally, you can just fill them with placeholder values.

### Initialise the database

To initialse the database, run `npx prisma migrate deploy`. This will create a `.db` file at the path we specified earlier.

### Populate problems and contests

To populate problem and contest data into the database, run the following two commands sequentially:

```bash
npm run syncProblems
npm run syncContests
```

### And finally, run the server

`npm run dev` starts the server: OI Checklist will be available at [localhost:5501](http://localhost:5501).

## Contributing

Bug reports, feature requests, and PRs are welcome. Feel free to file an issue or submit a fix.

### Adding problems and contests

The `data` folder contains all problem and contest data. Feel free to add problems and/or contests here. For the exact format, please refer to existing problems/contests.
